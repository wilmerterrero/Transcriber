# Transcriber

A SwiftUI app that records audio and uses OpenAI's Whisper model to transcribe it to text.

![Transcriber App Preview](https://via.placeholder.com/800x450.png?text=Transcriber+App+Preview)

## Features

- üéôÔ∏è **Record Audio**: Simple interface to record voice memos
- ü§ñ **AI Transcription**: Converts speech to text using OpenAI's Whisper model
- üìù **View Transcripts**: Review and manage your transcribed recordings
- üîä **Playback**: Listen to your recorded audio files
- üîÑ **Persistent Storage**: All recordings and transcriptions are saved between app sessions

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The app follows a clean architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **UI Layer**: SwiftUI views and components
- **Business Logic**: Manager classes coordinating app functionality
- **Data Layer**: SwiftData models for persistence
- **Utilities**: Helper classes for audio processing and file management

### Dependencies

- **SwiftUI**: UI framework
- **SwiftData**: Persistence framework
- **AVFoundation**: Audio recording and playback
- **AIProxy**: Integration with OpenAI's API

### Key Components

- `TranscriberView`: Main view with recording UI and list of transcriptions
- `TranscriberManager`: Central coordinator handling recording and transcription
- `AudioRecorder`: Handles audio recording functionality
- `TranscriberDataLoader`: Interfaces with OpenAI for transcription
- `AudioRecording` & `TranscribedAudioRecording`: SwiftData models
